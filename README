My lrn2rails app:

project salaryman aka yet another imageboard

streetmap (where we're going we don't need roads):

initial features:
- essentially an imageboard
- allow posting of youtube videos too
- users for admin/mods
- admin can create boards
- standard *chan-style "single" threaded conversations within a board
- to create a thread must post image or video
- admin/mods can delete threads
- logging

later ideas:
- trippers (tripcodes) are a different kind of user?
- can pm a tripper
- ajax it (new posts are displayed immediately)
- markdown for posts
- threads eventually die?
- IP based bans
- captcha

tech:

RoR (w/ Haml/Sass), Paperclip, RMagick, elbow grease, jQuery, MySQL
